CREATING THE GRAPHIC LOGO

Technicolor Dark theme uses a colorful graphic for the logo. Included with this theme is a header file called bg-technicolor-top.psd There is also a photoshop action to create your desired effect called Technicolor Dark.atn as well as support styles called Technicolor Dark Styles.asl 

Load your actions and your layer styles, then open the bg-technicolor-top.psd and place your text or logo on to the theme header. Run the action and and thats it. 

Save the entire bg-technicolor-top as a high or Highest quality jpg to the /assets/images/ folder replace the old file with your new file.

If you wish to have a graphic version of your logo but do not have photoshop, then I will be happy to create the graphic logo version for you. Please send me the name you wish to appear and the desired font family or a high quality version of your logo. Vector EPS is the desired format for best results.



NON GRAPHIC LOGO

If you do not want to use a graphic logo and instead wold rather use a text logo, you can do so by editing the css file for your theme. You only need to uncomment the section for the non logo version and then comment out the section for the graphic version. Each section is annotated so it should be clear what version is the correct one for you.



ADMIN STYLES

The admin comes with several predefined styles for this theme. These are not part of the original mango blog installation however I have found them to be helpful in my own blog. 

.button - Applies a button look to a standard text hyperlink.

.postGFX - If using a graphic created at 588x138 pixels you can apply a standard graphic frame to your image giving you the ability to apply many frame themes. or customize the theme to your liking. It also adds padding between the image and the paragraph.

.imgLeft & .imgRight - Applies a float left or right to a thumbnail graphic used in body text. It also applies a color border that matches the colors in the header.
