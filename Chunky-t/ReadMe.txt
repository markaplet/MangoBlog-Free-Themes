This theme makes use of the embedded font service from http://kernest.com The font "Chunk" is available for free to use on your site. (http://the-league-of-moveable-type.kernest.com/fonts/chunk) It does require you to create an account (free) and register the domain you are going to use this font on.

ADMIN STYLES

The admin comes with several predefined styles for this theme. These are not part of the original mango blog installation however I have found them to be helpful in my own blog. If you have styles already in use by your theme you may wish to change the following styles. 

.imgLeft & .imgRight - Applies a float left or right to a thumbnail graphic used in body text. It also applies a color border that matches the colors in the header.

.addborder - Adds 1 pixel border to images similar to the .imgLeft & .imgRight class.

.anchorSlide - If using my Anchor Slider plugin this class allows you to add sliding effect to jump likes within the admin editor.

BlueTrip CSS framework (http://bluetrip.org/) comes with some prebuilt styles so I added the most useful items here to the admin.
.caps - Makes text all capitals 
.fancy - Fancy script like font
.small - A smaller typeface that maintains vertical rythem
.large - A larger typeface that maintains vertical rythem
